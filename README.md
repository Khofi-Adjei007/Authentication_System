## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, password security is of paramount importance. This project aims to provide a robust password validation system for user sign-up flows, preventing the use of weak passwords and enhancing the security of user accounts. By integrating this system into your application, you can ensure that your users adopt strong password practices from the outset.

## Features

- **Password Complexity:** The system enforces password complexity requirements, including minimum length, the use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

- **Common Password Check:** A list of common and easily guessable passwords is included to prevent users from using such insecure passwords.

- **Customization:** The validation rules can be customized to suit your application's specific security requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-up-password-validation.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sign-up-password-validation`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Usage

1. Import the password validation module into your sign-up process.
   
2. Invoke the password validation function with the user-provided password during the sign-up process.
   
3. Receive validation feedback and guide the user to create a strong password.

```javascript
const passwordValidator = require('password-validator');

// Create a schema
const schema = new passwordValidator();

// Add properties to it
schema
  .is().min(8) // Minimum length 8
  .is().max(100) // Maximum length 100
  .has().uppercase() // Must have uppercase letters
  .has().lowercase() // Must have lowercase letters
  .has().digits(1) // Must have at least 1 digit
  .has().symbols(1) // Must have at least 1 special character
  .is().not().oneOf(['Passw0rd', '123456', 'qwerty']); // Blacklist some common passwords

const userPassword = "user-provided-password";

if (schema.validate(userPassword)) {
  console.log("Password is strong and secure.");
} else {
  console.log("Password does not meet the security requirements.");
}
